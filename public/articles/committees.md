## House Committees

As each House representative can't be expected to be well-informed and up to date on every topic, the House is organized into many different committees. These can be grouped into three categories:

**Standing Committees**: These committees are permanent and deal with issues in specific areas, such as science and technology, agriculture, or small business.

**Select Committees**: Select committees are formed to perform a specific task, such as running an investigation. They are generally tempororary and will be dissolved when they finish their task.

**Joint Committees**: Members of both the House and the Senate serve on a joint committee. Generally they are permanent and deal with administrative issues.

**Conference Committees**: This type of committee is similar to the joint committee in that it has both House and Senate members on it. However, conference committees are formed to reconcile discrepancies between House and Senate versions of a bill.
