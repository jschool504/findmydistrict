## Speaker of the House

The Speaker of the House has an important but sometimes poorly understood position in Congress. Indeed, the position itself is not defined in the Constitution, as it only states that the House should choose a speaker, but it does not even state the process behind doing this! Following will be a brief explanation of the process behind selecting the speaker, as well as their current role in our government.

### Selection

Candidates are first nominated by the majority and minority parties in the House. After the candidates have been picked, the entire House will then vote. Generally speaking, the candidate from the majority party wins. 

### Responsibilities

As the leader of the House the speaker has a wide variety of responsibilities, most of which are not defined by the Constitution. The document provides for the selection of a speaker but does not go into detail about what this person should do, and has such the role is defined by the customs and traditions that have grown up over since the country's founding.

Chief among these traditions is that the speaker does not vote or express a political opinion during legislative debates on the House floor. The only time the speaker does vote is when the entire chamber is tied. As you may expect, the speaker also maintains order during House proceedings, and has all the powers you would expect of the leadeer of a parlimentary group.

Much of the speaker's job is to maintain order in the House so that it may carry out it's task of lawmaking with some level of efficiency and respect. The speaker also acts as the House's representative and spokesperson to the public, the Senate and the President, though it should be noted that any differences in a bill passed by both the House and Senate require the formation of a conference committee to resolve the disagreements. The speaker does not debate legislative issues with the Senate, though that does fall under the term negotiation.

However, the speaker can appoint the members of joint, conference and select committees, giving both the speaker and the majority party a great deal of control over any special investigations that may need to take place as well as a large amount of say over bill discrepancies between the two chambers. Important to note is that the speaker can only appoint committees chairs and members to those three types of committees, not to standing committees, which deal with much more general topics.

### Other Interesting Facts
