## At-large District or Representative

Rather than subdivide their parent state into multiple localities, an at-large representative or district is elected by and speaks for all of a state's residents. This term can be a little odd if you don't know what it means (no, the House member is not larger than his peers). Most states do not use this system, so why is it that some do?

The reason has to do with how district populations are determined, as well as how representatives are assigned to states. The average district size is determined by the United States population (309,183,463) divided by the number of seats in the House (435) which means the average district size should be 710,767\. Each House member must represent around this number of people, otherwise you would have some districts with much more voting power than they should have given the size of their constituency. For example, if you had one district with 5,000,000 people and one district with 200,000 people, the 5,000,000 would be seriously under-represented as they get exactly the same amount of say as the 200,000\. This is obviously an unfair system, which is why all districts need to be close to the same size.

Congress determines the formula by which the representatives are distributed to the states, and the states draw the actual district boundaries. In this process states may end up with only one congressional district due to their population simply being too low to justify more than one representative, and it is at this point that we can say the state has an at-large district and representative.

A good example would be Alaska. As of the 2010 census, it's population was 710,231, which happens to be only 536 people shy of the ideal size for congressional districts! This makes it very easy to determine that Alaska should have only one representative and district, and as such we can say that they have a representative (and district) at-large.
